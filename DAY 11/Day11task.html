</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>3.What is Doctype in HTML?</b></summary>
    <p>The !DOCTYPE declaration in HTML (commonly referred to as "doctype") is a statement that defines the version of HTML that the webpage is written in.

    <p>Git and GitHub are related but serve different purposes in software development. Here's a breakdown of the differences: <br>

        1. Git: <br>
        Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS) that allows developers to track changes to code, collaborate with others, and manage different versions of a project efficiently. It operates locally on your computer and does not require an internet connection after installation. <br> 2. GitHub: <br>
        GitHub is a web-based platform built around Git. It provides a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories, making it easier for teams to collaborate, share, and manage projects. While Git is a tool for version control, GitHub adds several additional features that facilitate collaboration, code sharing, and project management. </p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><b>27.What is the workflow of github?</b></summary>
    <p>The GitHub workflow generally follows these steps: <br>

        1. Set Up a Repository: Create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine. <br>
        2. Create a Branch: Develop features or fix bugs in a separate branch from the main branch. <br>
        3. Make Changes: Edit files locally to implement your changes. <br>
        4. Stage Changes: Select the modified files you want to include in the next commit. <br>
        5. Commit Changes: Save your changes with a descriptive message. <br>
        6. Push Changes: Upload your branch and changes to GitHub. <br>
        7. Create a Pull Request: Propose merging your changes into the main branch for review. <br>
        8. Review and Merge: Collaborators review the pull request, provide feedback, and merge it if approved. <br>
        9. Update Local Repository: Synchronize your local repository with the main branch to keep it up to date. <br>
        
        This workflow supports collaborative development and version control.</p>
